# Snake case is a naming convention used in programming where words are separated by underscores ( _)
# instead of spaces or other characters. It is called "snake case" because the underscores resemble a snake slithering between the words.
# Some key points about snake case:
#  All letters are lowercase.
#  Words are separated by underscores.
# It is commonly used for variable names, function names, file names, and other identifiers in programming languages.
