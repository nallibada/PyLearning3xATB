# Task #1
# 	1. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
    # = operator is the assignment operator, which assign a value to the variable
    # == operatory is the comparison operator, which is used to compare two variable values for equality
# 	2. What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
    # ** operator is used to calculate the power of a number eg. x ** y means x to the power of y; say x=2 and y=3 then 2**3=8

# 3. What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
    # Python Bitwise Operators: Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
    #  XOR operator is used to compare two binary numbers. If the bits are different, the corresponding bit in the result is set to 1. If the bits are the same, the corresponding bit in the result is set to 0.
    # Example:
x=10
y=20
r=x^y
# if x^y :
#     print (x^y)

print (bin(x))
print (bin(y))
print (bin(r))
print (r)
